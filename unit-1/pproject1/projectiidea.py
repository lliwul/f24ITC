# I will create an function for images to be selected at random and generated from a folder of images

#i don't really know what i want to do for this project .. I feel a little uninspired to be create something here becus i'm not sure i understand the intention of the image generation
#i've decided to ask Chat GPT, we've talked a bunch already so it pulls from many of the things we've already discussed abt myself and it gave me this visionary idea that blends past, present, and future. Elements that inspire my ideas of progress, of art, and of strategy.

#This was chat's idea: Time Travel Collage (Future Vision): Pull random images from different time periods, like "modern," "vintage," and "futuristic." The generator could combine these to create collages that reflect your desire to be a visionary, blending past, present, and future.

#This is my interpretation:
#So im thinking we could develop one category for (vintage) old photos of people in black and white. one category for different font styles(modern), one category for setting(futuristic), and another for color and moodboard (nature).. I want this generator to give poster ideas, to show how timeless art and graphic design can be.. does this make sense?

#Chat said yes so let's proceed. So I will gather images and label them in folders respectively Vintage, Modern, Future, and Timeless.

#Chat has made these recommendations, Im liking it..
#You could randomize the placement of the font, the size of the figure, and even adjust the transparency to create more unique variations each time. Adding some light glitch effects, filters, or distortions might further enhance the timeless feel of the poster.
